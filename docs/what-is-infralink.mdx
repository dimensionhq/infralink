## What is Infralink?

Developers today are faced with a choice: either use a managed service like Heroku, or manage your own infrastructure with Kubernetes. It's a compromise between control over your infrastructure and ease of use.

Infralink gives you the best of both worlds. Get the DX of Heroku with the scalability of Kubernetes - all on AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Vultr or even your own servers.

Internally, Infralink uses Kubernetes to manage and scale your infrastructure - the same technology used by Google, Spotify, Amazon and more. But you don't need to know anything about Kubernetes to use Infralink. Just push your code and Infralink will take care of the rest.

Infralink's core offering is free, open source, and always will be. We plan to build useful opt-in features that you can leverage for faster builds, detailed analytics, and more.

## What do you get with Infralink?

Infralink doesn't just give you the basics - it gives you everything you need to deploy and scale a production-ready application. Here are some of the features Infralink offers:
