## Install the Infra CLI

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MacOS">```brew install infralink ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```winget install infralink``` or [Use the Installer]()
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">``` sudo apt get infralink ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create an `infra.toml` configuration files

Run `infra init` to create a new `infra.toml` configuration file in your current directory:

```sh
infra init
```

You'll see a prompt asking you whether or not you'd like to login:

```
You're not currently logged in to Infralink Cloud. Infralink Cloud comes with the following benefits:

- 🖥️  Dashboard
- 🔗 Automatic deploys from GitHub
- 📊 Usage analytics
- 🔍 Cost estimations
- 📝 Detailed logging and monitoring
- 💵 Predictive analytics with up-to 200% savings
- 🚀 Up-to 10x faster deployments with more powerful machines and collaborative caching
- 🙋 Support from K8s experts
- 🛡️  Advanced security compliance

> Would you like to login?
```

You can still use the CLI and deploy without logging in to Infralink Cloud, but you'll miss out on the benefits listed above. If you'd like to login, hit yes. Otherwise, hit no.

Next, you'll be asked to select an app name. This defaults to your current directory name:

```
> app name: (path)
```

You'll then be asked to select a cloud provider:

```
> cloud provider:
> aws
  azure
  gcp
  oracle
[↑↓ to move, enter to select, type to filter]
```

Once you've selected a cloud provider, you'll be enter your credentials for that provider. For example, if you selected AWS, you'll be asked for your AWS access key ID and secret access key.

These credentials are securely stored in your local machine's keychain.

Finally, select a region to deploy your app to.

Once you've completed this, you'll see a success message:

```
🎉 You're now ready to deploy your app. Run infra deploy to start.
```

This means that your [infra.toml configuration file](/configuration) has been created. It should look like this:

```toml
[app]
name = "cli"
cloud_provider = "aws"
region = "us-east-1"
```

### Deploy your app

Once you've run `infra init` and verified your [`infra.toml` configuration](/configuration) file is correctly setup for your use case, you can deploy your app with:

```
infra deploy
```

A docker container for your app will automatically be built based on your codebase. This process, in addition to the infrastructure provisioning process may take a few minutes.

<Note>
  Your first deploy will be slower than incremental deploys as infrastructure
  takes time to provision.
